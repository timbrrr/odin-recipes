            <li>
                <strong>Marinate the pork: </strong>In a bowl, mix 2 tablespoons of soy sauce, 2 tablespoons of fish sauce, 1 tablespoon of sugar, 1 tablespoon of honey, 2 minced garlic cloves, 1 tablespoon of minced lemongrass (optional), 1 tablespoon of vegetable oil, and 1 teaspoon of black pepper. Add 1 lb of thinly sliced pork shoulder or tenderloin and coat well. Let it marinate for at least 30 minutes, or ideally overnight in the refrigerator.

            <li>
                <strong>Grill the pork: </strong>Heat a grill or grill pan over medium-high heat and cook the pork slices for 3-4 minutes on each side until they're fully cooked and slightly charred. Set aside.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Prepare the sandwich: </strong>Slice a baguette lengthwise and toast it lightly. Spread mayonnaise (or spicy mayo) and pâté (optional) on the inside. Add grilled pork, pickled vegetables (carrots and daikon), cucumber slices, fresh cilantro, and optional jalapeño slices.
