    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <p></p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <strong>Prepare the dough: </strong>In a bowl, combine 2 ¼ teaspoons of active dry yeast and 1 teaspoon of sugar with 1 ½ cups of warm water (110°F). Let it sit for 5-10 minutes until it becomes foamy. Add 3 ½ cups of all-purpose flour, 2 tablespoons of olive oil, and 1 teaspoon of salt to the yeast mixture. Stir until a dough forms, then knead on a floured surface for 5-7 minutes until smooth and elastic. Place the dough in a lightly oiled bowl, cover, and let it rise in a warm place for 1 hour or until doubled in size.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Preheat the oven: </strong>While the dough rises, preheat your oven to 475°F (245°C). If you have a pizza stone, place it in the oven to preheat.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Shape the dough: </strong>Once the dough has risen, punch it down and divide it into 2 portions. Roll out one portion on a floured surface to your desired thickness. Transfer the rolled dough to a pizza peel or a baking sheet lined with parchment paper.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Add the toppings: </strong>Spread ½ cup of pizza sauce over the dough, leaving a small border around the edges. Sprinkle 1 cup of shredded mozzarella cheese and add your choice of toppings (pepperoni, vegetables, etc.). Drizzle a bit of olive oil on the crust edges.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Bake the pizza: </strong>Transfer the pizza to the oven, placing it on the preheated pizza stone or baking sheet. Bake for 10-15 minutes until the crust is golden and the cheese is melted and bubbly.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Serve: </strong>Remove from the oven, garnish with fresh basil (optional), slice, and serve hot.
            </li>
