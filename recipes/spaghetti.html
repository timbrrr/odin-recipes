    <p></p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <strong>Prepare the Meatballs: </strong>Preheat your air fryer to 375°F (190°C). Lightly spray the air fryer basket with nonstick cooking spray or brush with a bit of oil. Place the meatballs in a single layer in the basket, ensuring they aren't touching. Air fry the meatballs for 10-12 minutes, shaking the basket halfway through to ensure even cooking. They should be golden brown and cooked through with an internal temperature of 160°F (70°C).
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Make the Sauce: </strong>While the meatballs are cooking, heat 1 tablespoon of olive oil in a skillet over medium heat. Sauté 1 finely chopped onion and 2 minced garlic cloves for 3-4 minutes until softened. Add a 24-ounce jar of marinara sauce to the skillet, stirring well. Let the sauce simmer for 10 minutes. Once the air-fried meatballs are ready, gently add them to the sauce and let them simmer for a few minutes to absorb the flavors.
            <li>
                <strong>Shape the dough: </strong>Once the dough has risen, punch it down and divide it into 2 portions. Roll out one portion on a floured surface to your desired thickness. Transfer the rolled dough to a pizza peel or a baking sheet lined with parchment paper.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Cook the Spaghetti: </strong>Meanwhile, cook 12 ounces of spaghetti in salted boiling water according to the package instructions until al dente. Drain the spaghetti and serve it topped with the air-fried meatballs and sauce. Sprinkle with extra Parmesan cheese and fresh basil if desired, then enjoy!
